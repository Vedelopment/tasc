Elevator Pitch:
We asked ourselves, how hard could it be to make something better than Schoology that provides the same Schoology functionality, but with a better user experience and also was the location for all regular homework assignment and project completion?  We took it upon ourselves to look for a real world problem we faced and try to solve it.  We learned a whole lot in the process!
